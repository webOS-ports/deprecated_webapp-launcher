Summary
-------
webOS ports web application launcher

Description
-----------
This is the web application launcher for the Luna Next webOS UI platform. In difference to
the tradional approach of having a webappmanager component we're intending to launch every
application in it's own process by using WebKit2 and don't define a global application
manager for just web applications. Instead it's up to the application manager component in
the system to manage all different types (native, web) of applications.
